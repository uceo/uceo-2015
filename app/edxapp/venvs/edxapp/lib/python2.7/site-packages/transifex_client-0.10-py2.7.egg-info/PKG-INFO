        =============================
        
        The Transifex Command-line Client is a command line tool that enables
        you to easily manage your translations within a project without the need
        of an elaborate UI system.
        
        You can use the command line client to easily create new resources, map
        locale files to translations and synchronize your Transifex project with
        your local repository and vice verca. Translators and localization
        managers can also use it to handle large volumes of translation files
        easily and without much hassle.
